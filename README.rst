PyCukes
=======

PyCukes is a Cucumber-like BDD framework built on top of Pyhistorian.
PyCukes was created to fill the gap pyhistorian left, so with it is possible to talk to your stakeholders first with text files, instead of simple understendable python files like Pyhistorian.


What need to be done
====================
There is a simple StoryRunner, but there is no console to stakeholders/end-users run the stories.
