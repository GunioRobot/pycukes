Story: Message exchange
  As a good communicator
  I want to exchange messages through hooks
  So that the devs can add hooks support to pycukes

  Scenario 1: First
    Then I should have message1 attr   ... OK

  Scenario 2: Second
    Then I should have message1 attr   ... OK

  Ran 2 scenarios with 0 failures, 0 errors and 0 pending steps
hello world
